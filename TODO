Things that would be nice to have

* single table for all commands scheduled

* heartbeat on tasks, re-run if heartbeat missed etc

* python versions and venvs

* job run status - do we have this?

* conditional tasks (on fail etc)

* skip tasks

* branch tasks

* inter-task data

* logging

* dependency validation

* separation of functions from data storage

* light Job Task definitions so don't need all ratpiz in venv

* payload via db

* multiple job/task runs

* limits total tasks running

* basic front end

* basic cli - via scheduler

* time zones

* documentation

* tests

* db agnostic including RDB, nosql etc
